<h2>Search and Filter</h2>
<p>
You can search for Tor relays and bridges by using keywords.  In particular,
Atlas enables you to search for (partial) nicknames (e.g.,
&ldquo;moria&rdquo;), IP addresses (e.g., &ldquo;128.31.&rdquo;), and
fingerprints (e.g., &ldquo;9695DFC3&rdquo;).  It is also possible to combine
searches, e.g., &ldquo;moria 128.31.&rdquo;.  Finally, you can use qualifiers
to search for relays in specific countries (e.g., &ldquo;moria
country:us&rdquo;), with specific contact information (e.g.,
&ldquo;contact:arma&rdquo;), or with specific flags (e.g.,
&ldquo;flag:Authority&rdquo;).

<h2>Discover</h2>
<p>
You are able to get a detailed view of how the relay is configured. What its exit policy is and all the data that you would normally find in the descriptor.
</p>
<h2>Bridges</h2>
If you are searching for a bridge, you will need to search by the hashed
fingerprint. This prevents leaking the fingerprint of the bridge when
searching. You can find this in the <code>hashed-fingerprint</code> file in the
Tor data directory. On Debian systems, this is in <code>/var/lib/tor</code>
but may be in another location on your system. The location is specified as
<code>DataDirectory</code> in your <code>torrc</code>.

<h2>Graphs</h2>
<p>
The historical data of a relay's bandwidth usage is available in graph form.

<h2>Pure Client Side</h2>
<p>
This application is built in a way that all the logic is delegated to
the client.  This means that the amount of requests made to the server
can be minimized and that this application can potentially run by
being loaded locally. The server is only interrogated for JSON objects
that do not manipulate the DOM of the page.  The protocol used for
retrieving relay data is called <a href="https://onionoo.torproject.org/">Onionoo</a>.

<h2>Libraries</h2>
<p>
Atlas uses <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a> as an MV* framework, with <a href="http://requirejs.org/">require.js</a> for AMD loading of
dependencies. <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> and <a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore.js</a> as JS utility libraries.
<a href="https://datatables.net/">Datatables</a> for visualizing data in tabular form with custom filtering. <a href="https://d3js.org">D3.js</a> for making pretty charts.
<a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> as a CSS framework.
